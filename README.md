# [Hello there !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc&t=6s)
I made this game for Ludum Dare 39 !
I may continue working on it later, I'll probably do it on a branch though.

# Requirements

## Haxe 
The game was built using [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) 3.4.1

## Haxeflixel
Follow [this documentation](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) to install and setup Haxeflixel (I used flixel 4.3.0)

Make sure Haxe is using the correct versions for those packages :
```
haxelib set lime 2.9.1
haxelib set openfl 3.6.1
```

# Run the game
Open a terminal/command prompt and go to the game directory :
```
haxelib run lime test neko
```

# Compile
Also in the game directory, you can build the game to your platform

(You'll need a compiler installed for that)
```
haxelib run lime run PLATFORM
```
PLATFORM can be :
* linux
* mac (If anyone using a mac can tell me if this works, that would be great :D)
* windows
